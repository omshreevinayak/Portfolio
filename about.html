                                    In the competitive hospitality industry, customer satisfaction is paramount for the
                                    success and longevity of any booking platform. Traditional hotel booking websites
                                    like OYO often fall short when addressing user complaints, as these issues are
                                    directed solely to the hotel management. This can lead to unresolved problems,
                                    resulting in a tarnished reputation for the booking platform. The "Dual-Path
                                    Complaint Resolution: Enhancing Responsiveness in Hotel Booking Systems" project
                                    aims to bridge this gap by introducing a novel feature where user complaints are
                                    simultaneously sent to both the hotel administration and the website owner. This
                                    dual-notification system ensures a higher likelihood of issue resolution, thereby
                                    enhancing the overall user experience.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The primary problem this project addresses is the lack of accountability and
                                    responsiveness in current booking systems. When user complaints are only directed to
                                    the hotel, there is no guarantee that the issue will be resolved promptly or
                                    adequately. This lack of oversight can negatively impact customer trust and
                                    satisfaction, as users may feel neglected or ignored. By implementing a system where
                                    complaints are also sent to the website owner, there is an additional layer of
                                    accountability, ensuring that issues are more likely to be addressed and resolved
                                    efficiently.
                                    <br><br>
                                    This project seeks to fill the gap in existing customer service protocols within
                                    hotel booking platforms. The current one-directional complaint system often leaves
                                    users dissatisfied and can harm the reputation of the booking website. The
                                    dual-notification system not only holds the hotel accountable but also allows the
                                    website owner to monitor the quality of service provided by the hotels listed on
                                    their platform. This added transparency and responsiveness are crucial for
                                    maintaining a high standard of customer service.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The outcomes of this study are significant as they offer a practical solution to
                                    improve customer relations and maintain the integrity of the booking website. By
                                    addressing the issue of unresolved complaints, the project enhances user
                                    satisfaction and fosters trust in the platform. This is crucial for sustaining a
                                    competitive advantage in the digital hospitality market, where customer loyalty is
                                    key. By ensuring that user complaints are addressed promptly and effectively, the
                                    "Dual-Path Complaint Resolution: Enhancing Responsiveness in Hotel Booking Systems"
                                    can differentiate itself from competitors and build a loyal customer base,
                                    ultimately contributing to long-term success.
